Listening to the sounds of birds and the leaves being blown by the wind, and maybe even the sound of rain grounds me in the moment. It reminds of my true want in life: to run off and live in the forest away from society. We are all The Fool when it comes to life, and we all have found different ways to cope. Relax in this mini storm.</p>
